Release 1.0.0

- New Features/Fixed Issues

  [SNAP-953] Add RPM/DEB installer packaging targets using the Netflix Nebula ospackage gradle
  plugin.

  [SNAP-2039] Correct null updates to column tables. (#861)

  Use concurrent TrieMaps in SnappySession contextObjects, and queryHints map. Reason being that
  SnappySession can be read concurrently by multiple threads from same query for sub-query/broadcast
  kind of plans where planning for the BroadcastExchangeExec plan happens in parallel on another
  thread.

  [SNAP-2029] Added new "snappydata.preferPrimaries" option to prefer primaries for queries. (#852)
  Avoid double memory at the cost of reduced scalability but still having a hot backup.
  See discussion on Slack: https://snappydata-public.slack.com/archives/C0DCF0UGG/p1505460492000378

  Fixed a parser issue where AS can be optional in namedExpression rule. This fixes Q77 of TPCDS.

  [SNAP-2030] Now routed update and delete query on row table would return number of affected rows.

  [SNAP-2028] Snappy Python APIs fixes. (#851)
  A) Some of the SparkSession python APIs used to pass SQLContext to DataFrameWriter and
  DataFrameReader APIs.
  B) Fixed truncate table API.

  Fixed a couple of issues in parser. (#849)
  1. Order by and sort by clauses after partition by can be optional.
  2. INTERVAL non reserved key word was being treated as an identifier because of optional clauses
  ordering.

  [SNAP-2022] Remove the check which tested if any lead is already stopped, in snappy-stop-all.sh
  (#845). This was causing the script to skip shutting down of other running leads, if any. Added
   a check for rowstore, so that 'sbin/snappy-stop-all.sh rowstore' doesn't see the message.

  [SNAP-2020] Track in-progress insert size to avoid data skew. (#844)
  With many concurrent inserts/partitions on a node, significant data skew in inserts was still
  observed (on machines with large number of cores like 32) due to same smallest bucket being
  chosen by multiple partitions. This change now tracks the in-progress size for bucket and adds
  that to determine smallest bucket.

  [SNAP-2012] Skip locked entries in evictor. (#839)
  Fix as suggested by @rishitesh to use Unsafe API to try acquire monitor on RegionEntry.

  Hiding commands not applicable to snappydata (will be continued to be displayed for GemFireXD and
  RowStore mode). (#838)

  [SNAP-2003] Fix for 'stream to big table join CQ returning incorrect result'. (#829)
  HashJoinExec's streamPlan and buildPlan RDDs are computed on each CQ execution.

  [AQP-293] Changes for JNI UTF8String.contains. (#832)
  Convert UTF8Strings in ParamLiteral to off-heap when snappydata's off-heap is enabled.
  Changes in SnappyParser. Also, updated parboiled2 to latest release.

  [SNAP-1995] Added a python example showcasing KMeans usage. (#827)

  Fix an issue in collect-debug-artifacts script with extraction. Skip any configuration checks in
  collect-debug-artifacts for extraction (-x, --extract=).

  [SNAP-1993] Fixes for data skew when no partition_by is provided. (#825)
  With these changes, distribution in ColumnCacheBenchmark test, for example, is nearly equal most
  of the time among the buckets. Other cases like those reported originally with 7M rows have only
  ~50% difference between min and max (as compared to ~4X originally)

  Remove ParamLiteral for LIKE/RLIKE/REGEXP. If expression foldable is false, then LIKE family
  generates very suboptimal plan (if not converted to Contains/StartsWith/EndsWith) that will
  compile the Regex for every row.

  [SNAP-1984] Changes to retain UnifiedMemoryManager state across executor restart by copying the
  state in a temporary memory manager, which is created when store boots up but Spark environment is
  not ready. (#821)

  [SNAP-1981] For prepare phase, avoid rules that do not handle NullType since that is what is used
  as placeholder for params. (#815)

  [SNAP-1851] Properly closing the connection in case when connection commit fails. (#796)

  [SNAP-1976] Changes to set isolation level. (#813)
  Allow operations on row and column tables if isolation level is set to other than NONE and
  autocommit is true (query routing is enabled). If autocommit is false, query routing will be
  disabled and transactions on row tables will be supported. Queries on column tables will error out
  when query routing is disabled.

  [SNAP-1973][SNAP-1970] Avoid clearing hive meta-store system properties. (#816)
  The hive meta-store system properties are required to be set for static initialization of Hive and
  should not be cleared because a concurrent hive context initialization (from some other path) can
  see inconsistencies like system property found but not available when actually read.

  [SNAP-1979] Added MemoryManagerStats for capturing different stats for UnifiedMemoryManager.(#814)
  Smart Cconnector mode will not have these stats as GemFireXD cache will not be available.

  [SNAP-1982] Change batch UUID to be a long (#812)
  Now using region.newUUID to generate the batch UUID. Use colocatedRegion of column table (the row
  buffer) to generate the UUID since that is what smart connector and internal rollover uses.

  [SNAP-1611] Increased spark.memory.fraction from 92% to 97% (#808)
  We want to give a little buffer to JVM before it reaches the critical hep size.

  Make SnappySession.contextObjects as transient to fix the serialization issues reported on
  spark-shell when SnappySession gets captured in closures (e.g. import session.implicits._ with
  toDF)

  [SNAP-1955] Fixes for issues seen in parallel test runs (#805)

  [SNAP-1660] Remove password from product logging.

  [SNAP_1948] Added an option to specify streaming batch interval during streaming job submission.
  e.g. bin/snappy-job.sh submit --lead localhost:8090 --app-name appname --class appclass \
      --app-jar appjar --conf logFileName=demo.txt --stream --batch-interval 4000

  [SNAP-1893] Changed locator status to RUNNING after stopped locator is restarted with
  snappy-start-all.sh

  [SNAP-1877] GC issues with large dictionaries in decoding and other optimizations (#787)
  1. Performance issues with dictionary decoder when dictionary is large. 2. Data skew fixes. 3.
  Using a consistent sort order so that generated code is identical across sessions for the same
  query. 4. Reducing the size of generated code.

  Fix issues seen during concurrency testing (#782)

  [SNAP-1884] Fixed result mismatch in join between snappy table and temp table.

  Overridden two methods from Executor.scala. (#783) These methods have been added in Spark
  executor to check store related errors.

  [SNAP-1917] Properly comparing datatype of complex schema.

  [SNAP-1919][SNAP-1916] Added isPartitioned flag to determine partitioned tables (#784)

  [SNAP-1904] Use same connection for rowbuffer and columnstore.

  [SNAP-1883] Parser change for range operator.

  Fixed: After new job classloader changes executors are not fetching driver files. (#777)

  [SNAP-1894] Codegen issue for query with case in predicate expression (#772)

  [SNAP-1888][SNAP-1886] Fixed parser error in two level nested subQuery, works with Spark (#774)

  [Snap 1833] Fixed the synchronization problem with sc.addJar() (#728)

  [SNAP-1377][SNAP-902] Proper handling of exceptions in case of Lead and Server HA  (#758)

  [Snap 1871] Remove custom built-in jdbc provider and instead use spark's JDBC provider (#757)

  [SNAP-1882] Changes done for routing update and delete queries on column table to lead node.
  Also handled prepared statement on update and delete queries for column table.

  [SNAP-1885] Fixed Semijoin returning incorrect result (#768)

  [SNAP-1787] - Handling Array[Decimal] in both embedded and split mode (#754)

  [SNAP-1892] .show() after table creation using CreateExternalTable api gives empty/null
  entries, caused due to empty UserSpecifiedSchema instead of None (#764)

  [SNAP-1734] Query plan shows 0 number of output rows at the start of the plan. (#761)
  Snappy's execution happens in two phases. First phase the plan is executed to create a rdd
  which is then used to create a CachedDataFrame. In second phase, the CachedDataFrame is then
  used for further actions. For accumulating the metrics for first phase,
  SparkListenerSQLPlanExecutionStart is fired. This keeps the current executionID in
  _executionIdToData but does not add it to the active executions. This ensures that query is not
  shown in the UI but the new jobs that are run while the plan is being executed are tracked
  against this executionID. In the second phase, when the query is actually executed,
  SparkListenerSQLPlanExecutionStart adds the execution data to the active executions.
  SparkListenerSQLPlanExecutionEnd is then sent with the accumulated time of both the phases. For
  consuming SparkListenerSQLPlanExecutionStart, Snappy's SQLListener has been added. Overridden
  withNewExecutionId in CachedDataFrame so that the above explained process also happens when the
  dataset APIs are used.

  [SNAP-1878] Proper handling of path option while creation of external table using API (#760)

  [SNAP-1850] Remove connection used in JDBCSourceAsColumnarStore#getPartitionID v2 (#750)

  [SNAP-1389] Update and delete support for column tables (#747)

  [SNAP-1426] Fixed the Snappy Dashboard freezing issue when loading data sets (#732)

  Making background start of multi-node cluster as default

  [SNAP-1860] Close the connection if \commit/rollback is not done (#746)
  Made changes to make sure to commit/rollback the snapshot tx in case of exception. e.g Security
  related while trying to iterate over the region.

  [SNAP-1656] Security support in snappydata (#731)
  Enable LDAP based authentication and authorization in Snappydata cluster.

  Support for snapshot transactional insert in column table (#718)

  [SNAP-1825][SNAP-1818] DDL routing changes  (#742)
  Fix for ALTER TABLE ADD column does not work in case of row table when the table is altered
  after inserting data and CREATE ASYNCEVENTLISTENER doesn't work with lead node.

  Removing old 2.0.x backward compatibility classes.

  Fixes the "describe table" from Spark and shows the full schema.

  [SNAP-1268] Code changes to start SnappyTableStatsProviderService service only once. (#738)

  [SNAP-1838] skip plan cache clear if there is no SparkContext

  Fixes for issues found during concurrency testing (#730)

  [SNAP-1815] Disallow configuration of Hive metsatore using hive.metastore.uris property in
  hive-site.xml (#714)

  [SNAP-1708] collect-debug-artifacts script won't need both way ssh now. (#723)

  [SNAP-1723] When foldable functions are there in the queries and literals are there in their
  argument then identify case where Tokenization should be stopped. Added a bunch of such functions
  with corresponding relevant argument numbers for that. (#706)

  [SNAP-1806] Changed the exception handling in SnappyConnector mode. (#719)

  Support for setting scheduler pools using the set command (#700)

  [SNAP-671] Added support for DSID to work for column tables (#716)

  Added a task context listener to explicitly remove the obtained memory. (#713)

  [SNAP-1326] SnappyParser changes to support ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN DDLs (#711)

  [SNAP-1808] Create cachedbatch tables in user's schema instead of the earlier common schema
  SNAPPYSYS_INTERNAL. Changes from Sumedh @sumwale (#712)

  [SNAP-1805] Fixed Query Execution statistics are not getting displayed in SQL graph, caused
  because function to withNewExecutionId was executed before it was passed as argument (#703)

  [SNAP-1777] Increasing default member-timeout for SnappyData (#704)

  [SNAP-1610] Removing the code related to split cluster mode (that was disabled for users in 0.9
  release) (#696)

  [SNAP-1363] Performance degrades because of PoolExhaustedException when run from connector mode.
  Increasing max connection pool size since there is an idle timeout in the pool implementations
  (default: 120s), so cleanup of unused connections will happen in any case.

  [SNAP-1794] Modified code generation of DynamicFoldableExpression such that even the
  initMutableState splits into multiple init() functions, code will be generated properly. (#699)

  Changes for Apache Spark 2.1.1 merge (#695)

  [SNAP-1451] set default startup-recovery-delay to 102s for Snappy tables to avoid interfering
  with initial bucket creation.

  [SNAP-1722] Test to validate support for long, short, tinyint and byte datatypes for row tables
  (#689)

  Spark 2.1 Merge (#501)

  Fixing NoSuchElementException "None get" in dropTable. Using the global SparkContext directly
  instead of getting from active SparkSession (which may not exist) in hive meta-store listener.

  [SNAP-1688] CachedDataFrame memory allocation should be accounted with execution memory rather
  than storage memory.

  [SNAP-1748] Fixed: Without persistence, data loading is unsuccessful with eviction on (#682)

  [SNAP-1721] Avoid code generation failure in WorkingWithObject.scala example (#685)

  Changes for SNAP-1678 Smart connector should emit info logs that indicate the cluster to which it is connecting (#676)

  ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception in queries with wide schema having nulls.

  Corrected the scaladoc examples in SnappySession. (#672)

  Allow for spaces at start of API parser calls

  [SNAP-1737] While passing value to GemFireXD, it should ve converted from catalyst type to scala
  type.(#669)

  [SNAP-1735] use single batch count in stats row (#664)

  Renamed "-b" option to "-bg" to match convention used in other POSIX commands

  [SNAP-1725] Fix start and collect-debug scripts for Mac.

  [SNAP-1714] Correcting case-sensitivity handling for API calls (#657)

  [SNAP-1792] Snappy Monitoring UI now also displays Member Details View which shows member specific
  information, various statistics (like Status, CPU, Memory, Heap & Off-Heap Usages, etc) and
  members logs in incremental way.
  
  [Snap-1890] Snappy Monitoring UI displays new Pulse logo. Also product and it's build details are
  shown under version in pop up window.
  
  [Snap-1813] Pulse (Snappy Monitoring UI) users need to provide valid user name and password if
  SnappyData cluster is running in secure mode.

Release 0.9

- New Features/Fixed Issues

  [Snap-1286] Thin Client Smart Connector implementation.

  [SNAP-1235] Overhaul SnappyUnifiedMemoryManager to work properly for overflow.

  [SNAP-1454] Support for Off-Heap in column store.

  [SNAP-1413] install_jar does not work for Streaming jobs. Handled classloader in case of 
  Streaming factory as well.

  [SNAP-1424] Add a "shouldStop()" call to EncoderScanExec. The "shouldStop()" check is necessary 
  because if the target is a RowWriter (e.g. the parent is an EXCHANGE) then the same row gets 
  reused.

  [SNAP-1304] Implementation of Snapshot Isolation in snappydata.

  [SNAP-990] Column wise storage in region for better perf instead of full cachedbatch.
    
  [SNAP-1346] Plan caching ignoring constant values.

  [SNAP-1323] Support parameterized prepared statements for routed queries. Changes for improved
  execution of prepared statement on column table through JDBC route.

  JDBC CDC Streaming support. (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/622)

  [SNAP-1655] Support for boolean in row table.
    
  [SNAP-1705] Support slash ('/') and special characters in column names.

  [SNAP-1698] Snappy Dashboard UI Enhancements

  Multi-grid master (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/628)
    
  [SNAP-1545] Redesigned SnappyData Dashboard. Now displays detailed member description, heap and
  off-heap usage along with snappy storage and execution splits. It also displays cluster level
  aggregate Memory and CPU usage.

  [SNAP-1642] Avoid plan caching for queries with subqueries as the underlying changing data does
  not reflect in subsequent query.

  [SNAP-1221] Unable to restart server nodes in the cluster due to 
  ConflictingPersistentDataException.

  [SNAP-1461] Scalar subquery is only allowed to return a single row, while executing subquery on
  partitioned row table. This is fixed by routing any query with more than one table to lead node.

  [SNAP-1520] Switched to upstream Spark from snappy-spark-unsafe. Removed explicit 
  KryoSerializableSerializer registration for UnsafeRow and UTF8String in PooledKryoSerializer and
  instead call just the .register() method which will determine the serializer to be used by
  reflection.

  [SNAP-1615] If a column being aggregated has a NULL value while grouping on a string column, the
  grouping row itself produces a new row with Null column. As a fix, check the actual value while
  scanning row table for string column to decide whether its Null or not.
    
  [SNAP-1496] Wide table scan for column tables fails due to 64K limitation of JVM. As a fix, we
  now chunk the different parts of the scan code if the number of columns exceeds 30.
    
  [SNAP-1384] Column Table Inserts can fail if generated code is big. Modified ColumnInsertExec to
  handle wides schema to 1012 columns.

  [SNAP-892] SnappyData launch script picks localhost as the locator hostname and ignores 
  conf/locators, when invoked from non-locator host.
    
  [SNAP-1518] sbin/snappy-start-all/.sh does not start lead in a large cluster. As a fix, retry if
  Hive metastore initialization fails due to datastore being no yet available on servers.

  [SNAP-1400] When a server/cluster is restarted, sometimes incorrect results are observed. Added a
  check to get buckets from initialized members only.

  [SNAP-1344] As streaming jobs are recurring jobs, the earlier mechanism of removing dependent jar
  files were broken. Now we maintain a list of jars in the context itself and remove the jars when
  the streaming context is stopped.

  [SNAP-1494]: Dashboard shows an exception stack trace when a server goes down. Exception handled 
  and logged it into log file.

  [SNAP-1399] Updated column stats for complex type which was causing issue while inserting JSON 
  data to column table.
    
  [SNAP-1351] After a low memory exception is encountered, the snappy server does not remain stable.
  Snappy threads cannot be interrupted.

  [SNAP-1481] SQL Tab on UI, Description column now displays actual SQL Query string executed
  instead of handler description text.

  [SNAP-1442] Registering row table in catalog after its creation.

  [SNAP-1210] Fix NullPointerException caused when writing dataframe containing timestamp column to
  csv files by registering FastDatePrinter with KryoSerializer.

  [SNAP-1420] Removed the property "config.trace"->"substitutions" which is generating unneccessary
  logs.

  [SNAP-1435] Added support for off-heap in SnappyMemoryManager.

  [GITHUB-534][SNAP-1480] Code generation failure for nested GROUP BY. Match against variable name
  for dictionary optimization.

  [SNAP-1482] Tableau generated query fails with NumberFormatException. Fix parsing of full 
  engineering format double values.

  [SNAP-303] Handle non-store hive tables in meta-data queries.

  [SNAP-1459] StackOverflowError running query on Airline (narrow table) with small data set. As a
  fix, registering the classes with a multimap parameter which differentiates between the hashjoin
  and hashaggregate.

  [SNAP-1361] Added support for schema name in udf while querying e.g. select app.udfname(col_name)
  from table.

  [SNAP-1414] ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when creating sample table out of large dataset. As a
  fix, passing a reasonable initial size for the encoder term.

  Pruning partitions for predicates based on partitioning columns.
  (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/543)

  [SNAP-1441] Limit query on column table gives less number of rows (JDBC).

  [SNAP-1395] ElasticSearch connector gives NullPointerException when used with SnappyData.

  Enhancements in SDE

  - For an external table, the LogicalRelation was not storing the table identifier, thus 
  sample table replacement was not happening. Now passing table identifier in the logical relation.


Release 0.8

- Known Issues

  [SNAP-1384] Inserting into or querying a table with wide schema may fail with
  StackOverflowException due to a limitation of JVM.

- New Features/Fixed Issues

  [SNAP-1357] ODBC Driver and Installer. You can now connect to the SnappyData cluster using the
  SnappyData ODBC driver and execute SQL queries.

  [SNAP-1313] Multiple Language Binding using Thrift Protocol. SnappyData now provides support for
  Apache Thrift protocol enabling users to access the cluster from other languages that are not
  supported directly by SnappyData.

  [SNAP-490] Insert Performance Optimizations - Insert into tables is much more optimized and
  performant now. A new insert plan has been introduced which uses code generation
  and a new encoding format.

  Fixes backward compatibility with Spark 2.0.0 - The 0.8 SnappyData release is based on the Spark
  2.0.2 version. And, the SnappyData Smart Connector is now backward compatible with
  Spark 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 releases.

  [SNAP-1146] Fixes RowBuffer bloating. Data was not being aged into the internal compressed
  columnar format leading to unoptimized storage and hence bad query performances.

  [SNAP-1308] Incorrect number of entries displayed on UI if insert was being done from a Spark app
  using Smart Connector.

  [SNAP-1293] The driver process of external Spark app using Smart connector were incorrectly being
  displayed as members of SnappyData cluster.

  [SNAP-1282] The Spark web UI stopped working with SnappyData 0.7. Fixed.

  [SNAP-1243] UI incorrectly displaying multiple entries for the same lead node after restarts.

  [SNAP-1296] ResultsSet obtained from PreparedStatement.executeQuery returned 0 column count
  from its metadata. However SNAP-1311 needs to be fixed for complete support of Prepared
  Statement jdbc api. Being worked on.

  [SNAP-1291] Queries issued with execution-engine=store hint were getting ignored in some cases

  [SNAP-1287] Query execution using indexes on row tables was sometimes throwing ClasscastException

  [SNAP-1269] Create tables using schema of other table but with different column names were using
  column names of the source tables itself.

  [SNAP-1134] A job throwing exception remained in hung state instead of reporting failure

  [SNAP-982] Support for persistent UDFs added. Even after restart the UDF can be used now

  Enhancements in SDE
  - Sample selection logic enhanced. It can now select best suited sample table even if SQL
    functions are used on QCS columns while creating sample tables.

  - Poisson multiplicity generator logic for bootstrap is improved. Error estimated using
    bootstrap are now more accurate.

  - Improved performance of closed-form and bootstrap error estimations.


Release 0.7

  [SNAP-1260] Miscellaneous plan optimizations.

  [SNAP-1251][SNAP-1252] Avoid exchange when join columns are superset of partitioning.

  [SNAP-1112] Query hints for executionEngine doesn't work correctly.

  [SNAP-1240] SnappyData monitoring dashboard.

  [SNAP-1234] Always skip broadcast join for cases of collocated PR joins.

  [SNAP-1229] Fixed Snappy Python APIs broken after Spark 2.0 merge.

  [SNAP-1219] Unable to drop persistent column table when a server node is killed abruptly.

  [SNAP-1225] Performance improvements for hash joins (and other fixes).

  [SNAP-1218] Enable RDD-bucket de-linking for single table and replicated table joins.

  [SNAP-1217] Introduce Enable Experimental Feature property.

  [SNAP-1213] Using esoteric ExternalizableSerializable as default serializer for Externalizable
    rather than FieldSerialzable.

  [AQP-259] Fixing the issue where the size of the Map was not being assigned early enough,
    resulting in flush increasing the reservoir size in an unbounded manner.

  [SNAP-1209] Updated LocalJoin to cover colocated join cases as well.

  [SNAP-1205] Avoid exchange when the table is partitioned with the join key.

  [SNAP-1193] Optimized Collect aggregate plan to avoid last step exchange.

  [SNAP-1191] Basic plan caching (without constant tokenization). Add plan caching and reuse of
    SparkPlan, RDD and PlanInfo.

  [SNAP-1194] Optimization for single dictionary column GROUP BY and JOIN

  [SNAP-1136] Pooled version of Kryo serializer which works for closures.
    New PooledKryoSerializer that does pooling of Kryo objects (else performance is bad if new
    instance is created for every call which needs to register and walk tons of classes)

  [SNAP-1067] Optimized GROUP BY (HashAggregateExec) and HASH JOIN. Optimized hash table
    for GROUP BY (HashAggregateExec) and for LocalJoin.

  [SNAP-1087] Maintain stats (which include lower bound, upper bound, null count, etc.)
    for every column. And then uses the upper bound and lower bound values of columns to
    filter out the cached batches. This will be a perf enhancement for the queries which
    filters extensively.

  [SNAP-1084] Cache and return CatalogTable instead of going to hive

  [SNAP-1182] Added map/flatMap/filter/glom/mapPartition/transform APIs to SchemaDStream

  [SNAP-1180] Use ConfigEntry mechanism for SnappyData properties. Added SQLConfigEntry and
    convenience methods.

  [SNAP-999] Changes to remove the install jar and instead use SparkJobServer only.

  Apache Spark 2.0.2 merge.

  [SNAP-730] Add a rule to replace column tables with indexes when the join column is indexed.

  Removing the kafka-0.10 dependencies and shipping only kafka-0.8

  [SNAP-1075] Added a service to publish store table size that is used for query plan generation.
    These stats are also published on SnappyData Dashboard.

  [SNAP-1060] [SNAP-1141] [SNAP-1115] Fixes for Streaming related issues after Apache Spark 2.0
    merge.

  [SNAP-1152] Fixing NPE in aggregation. Handling null entry in ObjectHashMapAccessor during code
    generation.

  Avoid pooling of stream Input and Output objects in PooledKryoSerializer to try and fix occasional
    failures in TPCHDUnitTest.

  [SNAP-1172] Changes to render StringType as VARCHAR for tables created via API.

  [SNAP-1185] Changing all internal.Logging references to public one.

  [SNAP-1188] Set batch uuid to previous record if the current batchuuid is null.

  [SNAP-69] Fix SparkJobServer rootDir to point to current working directory instead of /tmp.
    Redirecting rootdir from /tmp to "-dir" startup parameter via gemfirexd.system.home variable
    set in the launcher.

  Fixing failure for optimized=T case in TPCETrade

  [SNAP-1147] Properly handle dropping of collocated table.

  [SNAP-1087] Removing StatsPredicateCompiler and closure; instead generate embedded predicate code
    in a new function in the same context as for ColumnTableScan code.

  [SNAP-977] Allow user to specify configuration on command-line while submitting a job.

  [SNAP-1021] Added an external catalog to SnappyCatalog to ensure the Catalog API of Spark will
    also work fine. This makes Snappy catalog cleaner and removes redundant code.

  [SNAP-1096] Add Lead attribute in Member MBean.

  [SNAP-1066] Modified existing tests to inferschema instead of using string and proper use of
    nullValue.
