# Here are examples using common configuration properties
# I) 
# Specify the host name on which a Snappy lead will be started. Also
# specify the directory where the logs and metadata files
# for that lead instance will be created. If the directory and properties
# are not specified a default directory is created inside the SNAPPY_HOME directory.
# 
#     lead1   -dir=/tmp/data/lead (config args)
#
# II) 
# Below is an example of how you can specify multiple locators for a lead and also
# set its heap size to 8 GB.
# 
#     lead1   -dir=/tmp/data/server -locators=locator1:9988,locator2:8899 -heap-size=8g
# 
# III)
# Another example which shows how to specify Spark properties.
# 
#     lead1   -dir=/tmp/data/server -spark.ui.port=3333 -spark.executor.cores=16
#
# IV) Start the SnappyData Zeppelin interpreter on the Lead node
#
#     lead1   -dir=/tmp/data/server -spark.ui.port=3333 -spark.executor.cores=16 -zeppelin.interpreter.enable=true
