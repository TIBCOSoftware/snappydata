     A SQL based DStream with support for schema/Product
     This class offers the ability to manipulate SQL query on DStreams
     It is similar to SchemaRDD, which offers the similar functions
     Internally, RDD of each batch duration is treated as a small
     table and CQs are evaluated on those small tables
     Some of the abstraction and code is borrowed from the project:
