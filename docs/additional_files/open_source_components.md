# SnappyData Community Edition (Open Source)

Starting with the 1.3.0 release, SnappyData Community Edition gets close to the erstwhile TIBCO ComputeDB Enterprise Edition in terms of the features.
Apart from the GemFire connector (that depends on non-OSS Pivotal GemFire jars), the 1.3.0/1.3.1 Community Editions
exceed the previous TIBCO ComputeDB Enterprise Edition 1.2.0 in both features and performance. You can find a list
of new features and performance improvements in the [release notes](../release_notes/release_notes.md).

The features hitherto available only in Enterprise edition - Off-heap storage for column tables, Approximate Query Processing, LDAP-based Authentication and Authorization, ODBC driver, to name a few -
are now available in SnappyData (community edition) as well.
