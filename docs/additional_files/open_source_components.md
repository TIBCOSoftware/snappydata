# SnappyData Community Edition (Open Source) and TIBCO ComputeDB Enterprise Edition

With the 1.3.0 release, SnappyData Community Edition gets even closer to the TIBCO ComputeDB Enterprise Edition, in terms of the features.

The features hitherto available only in Enterprise edition - Off-heap storage for column tables, Approximate Query Processing, LDAP-based Authentication and Authorization, to name a few - 
are now availble in SnappyData (community edition) as well.

The **Enterprise Edition** of the product, which is sold by TIBCO Software under the name **TIBCO ComputeDB™**, includes everything that is offered in the OSS version along with additional capabilities that are closed source and only available as part of a licensed subscription.
