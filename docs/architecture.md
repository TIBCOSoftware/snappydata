# Architecture Overview

This section presents a high-level overview of TIBCO ComputeDB’s core components. It also explains how our data pipeline (as streams) are ingested into our in-memory store and subsequently interacted with and analyzed.

The following topics are covered in this section:

* [Core Components](architecture/core_components.md)

* [Data Ingestion Pipeline](architecture/data_ingestion_pipeline.md)

* [Hybrid Cluster Manager](architecture/hybrid_cluster_manager.md)
