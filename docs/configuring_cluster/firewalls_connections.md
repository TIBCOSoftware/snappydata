# Firewalls and Connections

You may face possible connection problems that can result from running a firewall on your machine.

SnappyData is a network-centric distributed system, so if you have a firewall running on your machine it could cause connection problems. For example, your connections may fail if your firewall places restrictions on inbound or outbound permissions for Java-based sockets. You may need to modify your firewall configuration to permit traffic to Java applications running on your machine. The specific configuration depends on the firewall you are using.

As one example, firewalls may close connections to SnappyData due to timeout settings. If a firewall senses no activity in a certain time period, it may close a connection and open a new connection when activity resumes, which can cause some confusion about which connections you have.

## Firewall and Port Considerations

You can configure and limit port usage for situations that involve firewalls, for example, between client-server or server-server connections.

Make sure your port settings are configured correctly for firewalls. For each SnappyData member, there are two different port settings you may need to be concerned with regarding firewalls:

-   The port that the server or locator listens on for client connections. This is configurable using the `-client-port` option to the snappy server or snappy locator command.

-   The peer discovery port. SnappyData members connect to the locator for peer-to-peer messaging. The locator port is configurable using the `-peer-discovery-port` option to the snappy server or snappy locator command.

    By default, SnappyData servers and locators discover each other on a pre-defined port (10334) on the localhost.

### Limiting Ephemeral Ports for Peer-to-Peer Membership

By default, SnappyData utilizes *ephemeral* ports for UDP messaging and TCP failure detection. Ephemeral ports are temporary ports assigned from a designated range, which can encompass a large number of possible ports. When a firewall is present, the ephemeral port range usually must be limited to a much smaller number, for example six. If you are configuring P2P communications through a firewall, you must also set each the tcp port for each process and ensure that UDP traffic is allowed through the firewall.

### Properties for Firewall and Port Configuration

####  Store Layer

This following tables contain properties potentially involved in firewall behavior, with a brief description of each property. The [Configuration Properties](../reference/configuration_parameters/index.md) section contains detailed information for each property.

| Configuration Area | Property or Setting | Definition |
|--------|--------|--------|
|peer-to-peer config|[locators](../reference/configuration_parameters/locators.md)|The list of locators used by system members. The list must be configured consistently for every member of the distributed system.|
|peer-to-peer config|[membership-port-range](../reference/configuration_parameters/membership-port-range.md)|The range of ephemeral ports available for unicast UDP messaging and for TCP failure detection in the peer-to-peer distributed system.|
|member config|[-J-Dgemfirexd.hostname-for-clients](../configuring_cluster/property_description.md#host-name)|The IP address or host name that this server/locator sends to the JDBC/ODBC/thrift clients to use for the connection.|
|member config|[client-port](../reference/command_line_utilities/store-run.md) option to the [snappy server](../configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster.md#configuring-data-servers) and [snappy locator](../configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster.md#configuring-locators) commands|Port that the member listens on for client communication.|
|Locator|[locator command](../configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster.md#configuring-locators)|10334|

#### Spark Layer

The following table lists the Spark properties you can set to configure the ports required for Spark infrastructure.</br>Refer to [Spark Configuration](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html) in the official documentation for detailed information.

| Property | Default |Description|
|--------|--------|--------|
|spark.blockManager.port |random|Port for all block managers to listen on. These exist on both the driver and the executors.|
|spark.driver.blockManager.port  |(value of spark.blockManager.port)|Driver-specific port for the block manager to listen on, for cases where it cannot use the same configuration as executors.|
|spark.driver.port |random	|	Port for the driver to listen on. This is used for communicating with the executors and the standalone Master.|
|spark.port.maxRetries|16|Maximum number of retries when binding to a port before giving up. When a port is given a specific value (non 0), each subsequent retry will increment the port used in the previous attempt by 1 before retrying. This essentially allows it to try a range of ports from the start port specified to port + maxRetries.
|spark.shuffle.service.port |7337|Port on which the external shuffle service will run.|
|spark.ui.port |4040|	Port for your application's dashboard, which shows memory and workload data.|
|spark.ssl.[namespace].port  |None|The port where the SSL service will listen on.</p>The port must be defined within a namespace configuration; see SSL Configuration for the available namespaces.</p> When not set, the SSL port will be derived from the non-SSL port for the same service. A value of "0" will make the service bind to an ephemeral port.|
|spark.history.ui.port|The port to which the web interface of the history server binds.|18080|
|SPARK_MASTER_PORT	|Start the master on a different port.|Default: 7077|
|SPARK_WORKER_PORT	|Start the Spark worker on a specific port.|(Default: random|

## Locators and Ports

The ephemeral port range and TCP port range for locators must be accessible to members through the firewall.

Locators are used in the peer-to-peer cache to discover other processes. They can be used by clients to locate servers as an alternative to configuring clients with a collection of server addresses and ports.

Locators have a TCP/IP port that all members must be able to connect to. They also start a distributed system and so need to have their ephemeral port range and TCP port accessible to other members through the firewall.

Clients need only be able to connect to the locator's locator port. They don't interact with the locator's distributed system; clients get server names and ports from the locator and use these to connect to the servers. For more information, see [Using Locators](configuring_cluster.md#configuring-locators).
