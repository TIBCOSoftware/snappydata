# Cluster Maintenance

To perform maintenance of your cluster you may need to manage on the components of your cluster, you may need to stop or start services running on that cluster, modify allocated resources, or stop certain components while the service is still running.

TIBCO ComputeDB provides a variety of methods for performing system maintenance.

Cluster maintenance involves:

## [Starting a cluster](../howto/start_snappy_cluster.md)

* with one locator, lead and server

* With one locator, one lead and one server with specified heap size and memory size

* Start a cluster of x locators, y servers and z leads

## Add Servers to a Cluster
To add an additional server to an existing cluster:

### Add Servers to a Running Cluster
To add an additional server to a running cluster:

## Stop and Restart a Specific Server 
(same point or different points start/restart?)

## Rebalancing the Cluster

## Backup and Restore the Cluster

When you back up a cluster, a back up is create of the operational disk stores for all members running in the distributed system, and each member with persistent data creates a backup of its own configuration and disk stores.
