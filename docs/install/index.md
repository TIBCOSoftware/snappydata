# Provisioning SnappyData

The SnappyData **Community Edition** is Apache 2.0 licensed. It is a free, open-source version of the product that can be downloaded by anyone.
The erstwhile **Enterprise Edition** of the product, which is sold by TIBCO Software under the name **TIBCO ComputeDBâ„¢**, includes everything that is offered in the Community Edition along with additional capabilities that are closed source and only available as part of a licensed subscription.

As of the 1.3.0 release, all components that were previously closed source are now OSS (except for the
GemFire connector), and there is only the **Community Edition** that is released.

For more information on the capabilities of the Community Edition and differences from the previous Enterprise Edition, see [Community Edition (Open Source)](../additional_files/open_source_components.md).

## SnappyData Provisioning Options


### Prerequisites

Before you start the installation, make sure that Java SE Development Kit 8 is installed, and the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable is set on each computer.

The following options are available for provisioning SnappyData:

* [On-Premise](install_on_premise.md) <a id="install-on-premise"></a>

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](setting_up_cluster_on_amazon_web_services.md) <a id="setting-up-cluster-on-amazon-web-services-aws"></a>

* [Kubernetes](../kubernetes.md)

* [Docker](../quickstart/getting_started_with_docker_image.md)

* [Building from Source](building_from_source.md)<a id="building-from-source"></a>

### Configuring the Limit for Open Files and Threads/Processes

On a Linux system, you can set the limit of open files and thread processes in the **/etc/security/limits.conf** file. 
</br>A minimum of **8192** is recommended for open file descriptors limit and **>128K** is recommended for the number of active threads. 
</br>A typical configuration used for SnappyData servers and leads can appear as follows:

```pre
snappydata          hard    nofile      32768
snappydata          soft    nofile      32768
snappydata          hard    nproc       unlimited
snappydata          soft    nproc       524288
snappydata          hard    sigpending  unlimited
snappydata          soft    sigpending  524288
```
* `snappydata` is the user running SnappyData.

Recent linux distributions using systemd (like RHEL/CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04) require the **NOFILE** limit to be increased in systemd configuration too. Edit **/etc/systemd/system.conf ** as root, search for **#DefaultLimitNOFILE** under the **[Manager] **section. Uncomment and change it to **DefaultLimitNOFILE=32768**. 
Reboot for the above changes to be applied. Confirm that the new limits have been applied in a terminal/ssh window with **"ulimit -a -S"** (soft limits) and **"ulimit -a -H"** (hard limits).
