# Monitoring with Metrics

Metrics constitutes of the measurements of resource usage or behavior that can be observed and collected all over SnappyData clusters. Using the Metrics, you can monitor the cluster health and statistics.  Monitoring the clusters allows you to do the following:

*	Increase availability by quickly detecting downtime/degradation.
*	Facilitate performance monitoring by external tools. These external tools can handle functions such as metrics aggregation, alerting, and visualization.

SnappyData uses the [Sparkâ€™s Metrics Subsystem](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics) for metrics collection. This system allows you to publish the metrics to a variety of sinks that you can enable for metrics collection. 
Spark supports the following sinks for Metrics. SnappyData can send metrics to all these sinks. However, MetricsServlet sink is enabled by default and all the metrics get published here.

| Sink | Description |
|--------|--------|
|   MetricsServlet     |  Adds a servlet within the existing Spark UI to serve metrics data as JSON data. </br>The metrics are published here by default and can be easily accessible via a web page. </br>The servlet URL is http://<leadhost>:5050/metrics/json.        |
|      JmxSink  |     Register metrics for viewing in a JMX console. Monitoring tools/ agents that understand the JMX protocol, such as JMX exporter from Prometheus, can export this information to external monitoring systems for storage and visualization.   |
|   CsvSink     |   Exports metrics data to CSV files at regular intervals.     |
|      ConsoleSink  |   Logs metrics information to the console.    |
|      GraphiteSink  |     Sends metrics to a Graphite node.   |
|  Slf4jSink      |    Sends metrics to slf4j as log entries.    |

!!!Note
	You cannot store metrics for long term retention as well as for archival purposes. Detailed instructions for integration with external monitoring systems to build monitoring dashboards by sourcing metrics data from the sinks will be published in a future release.

Whenever you start the cluster, the metrics are published and made available through commonly used sinks, which can be consumed by monitoring tools. 

!!!Note
	Metrics are not published for Smart Connector mode. 

The following type of metrics are made available for SnappyData:

*	**Availability Metrics**</br>
	This type of metrics alerts about the status and availability of the cluster. 
	
    Examples:
    
	*	Cluster and node status
	*	Cluster and node uptime/downtime
	*	Member Statistics
	*	Table Statistics

*	**Performance Metrics**</br>
	This type of metric provides insights into system performance. 

	Examples:
    
    *	Resource usage for system-level resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.
    *	Resource usage for SnappyData application/component resources such as heap or off-heap memory and their percentage utilization etc.

## Enabling the Sinks for Metrics collection

If you want to publish the SnappyData metrics using any of the sinks, you must enable these sinks in the **metrics.properties** file, which is located in the **conf** folder of the SnappyData installation directory. 

To enable a sink, do the following:

1.	Open the **conf** folder and change the name of **metrics.properties.template** to  **metrics.properties** file. 
	
    	cp metrics.properties.template metrics.properties
    
2.	Uncomment the properties (remove the #) of the sink that you want to enable and provide the necessary property values. For example, for enabling CsvSink, you must uncomment the following properties:

        # Enable CsvSink for all instances by class name
        *.sink.csv.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.CsvSink

        # Polling period for the CsvSink
        *.sink.csv.period=1

        # Unit of the polling period for the CsvSink
        *.sink.csv.unit=minutes

        # Polling directory for CsvSink
        *.sink.csv.directory=/tmp/

        # Polling period for the CsvSink specific for the worker instance
        worker.sink.csv.period=10

        # Unit of the polling period for the CsvSink specific for the worker instance
        worker.sink.csv.unit=minutes

3.	Start the cluster for the configurations to take effect by executing this command from the SnappyData installation folder:

			./sbin/snappy-start-all.sh


!!!Note
	In case you make changes to **metrics.properties** file when the cluster is running, you must always restart the cluster for the configuration changes to reflect. 

## Accessing Metrics

You can check the SnappyData metrics collected through **MetricsServlet**, which is enabled by default, at the following URL: `<LeadNode-hostname>:<5050>/metrics/json`

### Accessing Metrics from JmxSink 
Do the following to access Metrics from JmxSink:

1.	If **org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.JmxSink** is enabled in the **metrics.properties** file, you can use **JConsole** to access Metrics captured through JmxSink. To enable JmxSink, uncomment the properties for the JmxSink in the **metrics.properties** file. For example:

			*.sink.jmx.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.JmxSink

2.	Launch **JConsole** and connect to the host on which primary lead node is running, select the process ID of SnappyData primary lead process. 
3.	Go to **MBeans** > **metrics**, to access the SnappyData Metrics. 
	        
!!!Note
	To access metrics for remote processes, you need to add the following JMX remote properties in the node configuration file:</br>`-jmx-manager=true -jmx-manager-start=true -jmx-manager-port=<port_value>`

### Accessing Metrics from CsvSink 
Do the following to access Metrics from CsvSink:

1.	If **org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.CsvSink** is enabled in the **metrics.properties** file, you can access the metrics captured in the CSV files at the location specified in the ** *.sink.csv.directory** property.  To enable CsvSink, uncomment the properties for the CsvSink in the **metrics.properties** file. For example, 

    	*.sink.csv.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.CsvSink
 
!!!Note
	You must ensure that the location mentioned in the ***.sink.csv.directory** property already exists and has write permissions.

## Disabling Metrics Collection

To disable the metrics collection for a specific Sink, edit the **metrics.properties** file and comment the corresponding entries by adding the prefix **#** to the required lines. Save the file and then restart the cluster. 


## Statistics

The following statistics in SnappyData are collected when you Metrics monitoring is enabled.
