# Recovering Data During Cluster Failures
In scenarios where the SnappyData cluster fails to come up due to some issues, the Data Extractor utility can be used to retrieve the data in a standard format along with the schema definitions.

Typically, the SnappyData cluster starts when all the instances of the servers, leads, and locators within the cluster are started. However, sometimes, the cluster does not come up. In such situations, there is a possibility that the data inside the cluster remains either entirely or partially unavailable.
In such situations, you must first refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Problems](../troubleshooting/index.md) section in the SnappyData product documentation, fix the corresponding issues, and bring up the cluster. Even after this, if the cluster cannot be started successfully, due to unforeseen circumstances, you can use the Data Extractor utility to start the cluster in Recovery mode and salvage the data.

Data Extractor utility is a read-only mode of the cluster. In this mode, you cannot make any changes to the data such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE/ALTER etc. Moreover, in this mode, the inter-dependencies between the nodes during the startup process is minimized. Therefore, reducing failures during startup. 

In the Recovery mode:

*	You cannot perform operations with Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
*	You are provided with procedures to extract data, DDLs, etc., and generate load-scripts.
*	You can launch the Snappy shell and run SELECT/SHOW/DESCRIBE queries.

## Extracting Data in Recovery Mode

To bring up the cluster and salvage the data, do the following:

1.	[Launch the cluster in a Recovery mode](#launchclusterrecovery)
2.	[Retrieve table definitions and data](#retrievedata)
3.	[Load a new cluster with data extracted from Recovery mode](#loadextractdata)

### Launching a Cluster in Recovery Mode

Launching a cluster in recovery mode is similar to launching it in the regular mode. To specify this mode, all one has to do is pass an extra argument `-r` or `--recover` to the cluster start script as shown in the following example:

```
snappy-start-all.sh -r
```

!!!Caution
	* DDL or DML cannot be executed in a recovery Mode.
	* Recovery mode does not repair the existing cluster.
<a id= retrievedata> </a>
### Retrieving Metadata and Table Data

After you bring the cluster into recovery mode, you can retrieve the metadata and the table data in the cluster. The following system procedures are provided for this purpose:

*	[EXPORT_DDLS](../reference/inbuilt_system_procedures/export_ddl.md)
*	[EXPORT_DATA](../reference/inbuilt_system_procedures/export_data.md)

Thus the table definitions and tables in a specific format can be exported and used later to launch a new cluster. 

!!!Caution
	*   Ensure there is enough disk space, preferably double the existing cluster size, to store the recovered data.
    *   If the DDL statements that are used on the cluster have credentials, it will appear masked in the output of the procedure EXPORT_DDLS. You must replace it before using the file. For example: JDBC URL in external tables, Location URIs in table options.


!!!Note
	In the recovery mode, you must check the console, the logs of the server, and the lead for errors. Also, check for any tables that are skipped during the export process. In case of any failures, visit the [Known issues](#knownissues) in  or [Troubleshooting Common Problems](#trouble) section in the product documentation to resolve the failures.

## Loading a New Cluster with Extracted Data

After you extract the DDLs and the data from the cluster, do the following to load a new cluster with the extracted data:

1.	Verify that the exportURI that is provided to `EXPORT_DATA` contains the table DDLs and the data by listing the output directories. Also, ensure that the directory contains one sub-directory each for the tables in the cluster and that these sub-directories are not empty. If a sub-directory corresponding to a table is empty, stop proceeding further, go through the logs to find if there are any skipped or failed tables. In such a case, you must refer to the troubleshooting section for any known fixes or workarounds.
2.	Clear or move the work directory of the old cluster only after you have verified that the logs do not report any failures for any tables and that you have ensured to complete step 1.
3.	Start a new cluster.
4.	Connect to Snappy shell. 
5.	Use the exported DDLs and helper load-scripts to load the extracted data into the new cluster. 
	
    **For example**
	
           snappy-sql> run ‘/home/xyz/extracted/ddls_1571059691610/part-00000’;
					snappy-sql> run 
                    ‘/home/xyz/extracted/data_1571059786952_load_scripts/part-00000’;	
	
### Example of Using Data Extractor Utililty 

Here is an example of using the DataExtractor utility to salvage data from a faulty cluster or a healthy cluster. The following are the sequence of steps to follow:

1.	Start a fresh cluster and create a table that you can attempt to recover using this example. 
2.	Start the Snappy shell and run the following DDL and INSERT statements:

            snappy-sql
            
            SnappyData version 1.2-SNAPSHOT
                snappy-sql> connect client 'localhost:1527';
                snappy-sql> create table customers(cid integer, name string, phone varchar(20));
                snappy-sql> insert into customers values (0, 'customer1', '9988776655'), (0, 'customer1', '9988776654');
                snappy-sql> exit;

3.	Run the `snappy-stop-all.sh`
and ensure that all the instances of cluster services are stopped. You can confirm this by 
checking the output of **jps**  to verify that the services (ServerLauncher,LeaderLauncher,LocatorLauncher) are not present.

            snappy-stop-all.sh 
            
            The SnappyData Leader on user1-dell(localhost-lead-1) has stopped.
            The SnappyData Server on user1-dell(localhost-server-1) has stopped.
            The SnappyData Locator on user1-dell(localhost-locator-1) has stopped.
            jps
            11684 Main
            14295 Jps

4.	 Run the command `snappy-start-all.sh -r` to launch the cluster in recovery mode. Check the console output and take a note of all the instances that could come up and those that fail to come up.

            snappy-start-all.sh  -r
            
            Logs generated in /home/user1/workspace/snappydata/build-artifacts/scala-2.11/snappy/work/localhost-locator-1/snappylocator.log

5.	If any of the members fail to come up, and if redundancy is not used, there could be a partial loss of data that is hosted on those particular members. If the cluster comes up successfully, launch Snappy shell, then you 
can run the SELECT queries or the provided procedures to export DDLs, Data of the cluster. Run the procedure **EXPORT_DDLS** to export the definitions of tables, views, UDFs etc.

            snappy-sql
            
            SnappyData version 1.2-SNAPSHOT 
            snappy-sql>  connect client 'localhost:1527';
            snappy-sql> call sys.EXPORT_DDLS('/tmp/recovered/ddls');
            snappy-sql> exit;
            
            ls /tmp/recovered/ddls_1576074336371/

            cat /tmp/recovered/ddls_1576074336371/part-00000
            create table customers(cid integer, name string, phone varchar(20));
           
           ## Next, run the procedure “EXPORT_DATA” to export the data of selected tables to selected location.
           
           	snappy-sql
            SnappyData version 1.2-SNAPSHOT 
            snappy-sql> connect client 'localhost:1527';
            snappy-sql> call sys.EXPORT_DATA('/tmp/recovered/data', 'csv', 'all', true);
            snappy-sql> exit;
            ls /tmp/recovered/data_1576074561789
            
            APP.CUSTOMERS
            ls /tmp/recovered/data_1576074561789/APP.CUSTOMERS/
            part-00000-5da7511d-e2ca-4fe5-9c97-23c8d1f52204.csv  _SUCCESS
            cat /tmp/recovered/data_1576074561789/APP.CUSTOMERS/part-00000-5da7511d-e2ca-4fe5-9c97-23c8d1f52204.csv

            cat /tmp/recovered/data_1576074561789_load_scripts/part-00000 
            
            CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE temp_app_customers USING csv
            OPTIONS (PATH '/tmp/recovered/data_1576074561789//APP.CUSTOMERS',header 'true');
            INSERT OVERWRITE app.customers SELECT * FROM temp_app_customers;

6.	With both the DDLs and data exported you can use the helper scripts that are already generated by the procedure **EXPORT_DATA** to load data into a fresh cluster. For the purpose of the example,  the work directory is stopped and cleared of the existing cluster and the cluster is launched in the normal mode to simulate a fresh cluster. After this, run the DDL script, and the helper load script to load the extracted data back into the fresh cluster.

## Viewing the User Interface in Recovery Mode
In the recovery mode, by default, the table counts and sizes do not appear on the UI. To view the table counts, you should set the property **snappydata.recovery.enableTableCountInUI** to **true** in the lead's conf file. By default, the property is set to **false**, and the table count is shown as **-1**.

The cluster that you have started in the recovery mode with the flag, can get busy fetching the table counts for some time based on the data size. If the table counts are enabled and there is an error while reading a particular table, the count is shown as **-1**.

<a id= knownissues> </a>
## Known Issues

*	If one of the replicas of the table partitions is corrupt, the Data Extractor utility attempts to recover data from redundant replicas. However, if the redundancy is not available, and if the data files are corrupt, the utility fails to recover data.
*	The Leader log contains an error message: ***Table/View 'DBS' does not exist***. You can ignore this message.

<a id= trouble> </a>
## Troubleshooting

*	Your SnappyData cluster has tables with big schema or a large number of buckets and this cluster has stopped without any exceptions in the log.	
    **Workaround**: Add the property, `-recovery-state-chunk-size` into the conf files of each server, and set the value lower than the current(default 30). This property is responsible for chunking the table information while moving across the network in recovery mode.
	For example: `localhost -recovery-state-chunk-size=10` </br>	

*	An error message, ***Expected compute to launch at x but was launched at y*** is shown. </br>
    **Workaround**: Increase the value of the property `spark.locality.wait.process` to higher than the current value (default 1800s).
    The error could be due to any of the following reasons:
	*	The data distribution is skewed, which causes more tasks to be assigned to **server x** which further leads to time-out for some tasks, and are re-launched on **server y**.
	*	The expected host is the best option to get the data; others are not in good shape.
	It is imperative to use a specific host for a particular partition( of a table) to get data in recovery mode reliably.
    
    You can also face this error when there was a failure on **server** **x** hence the task scheduler re-launches the task on server **y**, without waiting for the time-out. In this case the log for **server** **x** should be analysed for errors.
   
*	You are facing memory-related issues such as **LowMemoryException** or if the server gets killed and a `jvmkill_<pid>.log` is generated in the server directory. In such a case enough memory may not be available to the servers.</br>	
	**Workaround**: Decrease the number of CPUs available for each server. This action ensures that at a time, less number of tasks are launched simultaneously. You can also decrease the cores by individually setting the `-spark.executor.cores` property to a lower value, in the server's conf file. After this, restart the cluster in recovery mode and again export the failed tables.
