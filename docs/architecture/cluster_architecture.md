# SnappyData Cluster Architecture
A SnappyData cluster is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network comprised of three distinct types of members as represented in the below figure.

1. Locator: Locator members provide discovery service for the cluster. They inform a new member joining the group about other existing members. A cluster usually has more than one locator for high availability reasons.

2. Lead Node: The lead node member acts as a Spark driver by maintaining a singleton SparkContext. There is one primary lead node at any given instance but there can be multiple secondary lead node instances on standby for fault tolerance. The lead node hosts a REST server to accept and run applications. The lead node also executes SQL queries routed to it by “data server” members.

3. Data Servers: A data server member hosts data, embeds a Spark executor, and also contains a SQL engine capable of executing certain queries independently and more efficiently than Spark. Data servers use intelligent query routing to either execute the query directly on the node or pass it to the lead node for execution by Spark SQL.

SnappyData also has multiple deployment options. For more information refer to, [Deployment Options](../affinity_modes/index.md).

## Interacting with SnappyData

!!! Note 
	For the section on the Spark API, it is assumed that users have some familiarity with [core Spark, Spark SQL, and Spark Streaming concepts](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).
	And, you can try out the Spark [Quick Start](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html). All the commands and programs listed in the Spark guides work in SnappyData as well.
	For the section on SQL, no Spark knowledge is necessary.

To interact with SnappyData, interfaces are provided for developers familiar with Spark programming as well as SQL. JDBC can be used to connect to the SnappyData cluster and interact using SQL. On the other hand, users comfortable with the Spark programming paradigm can write jobs to interact with SnappyData. Jobs can be like a self-contained Spark application or can share the state with other jobs using the SnappyData store.

Unlike Apache Spark, which is primarily a computational engine, the SnappyData cluster holds mutable database state in its JVMs and requires all submitted Spark jobs/queries to share the same state (of course, with schema isolation and security as expected in a database). This required extending Spark in two fundamental ways.

1. **Long running executors**: Executors are running within the SnappyData store JVMs and form a p2p cluster.  Unlike Spark, the application Job is decoupled from the executors - submission of a job does not trigger launching of new executors.

2. **Driver runs in HA configuration**: Assignment of tasks to these executors are managed by the Spark Driver.  When a driver fails, this can result in the executors getting shut down, taking down all cached state with it. Instead, SnappyData leverages the [Spark JobServer](https://github.com/spark-jobserver/spark-jobserver) to manage Jobs and queries within a "lead" node.  Multiple such leads can be started and provide HA (they automatically participate in the SnappyData cluster enabling HA).

In this document, mostly the same set of features via the Spark API or using SQL is showcased. If you are familiar with Scala and understand Spark concepts you can choose to skip the SQL part go directly to the [Spark API section](../programming_guide/sparksession_snappysession_and_snappystreamingcontext.md).

## High Concurrency in SnappyData
Thousands of concurrent ODBC and JDBC clients can simultaneously connect to a SnappyData cluster. To support this degree of concurrency, SnappyData categorizes incoming requests from these clients into low latency requests and high latency ones.

For low latency operations, Spark’s scheduling mechanism is completely bypassed and directly operate on the data. High latency operations (for example, compute intensive queries) are routed through Spark’s fair scheduling mechanism. This makes SnappyData a responsive system, capable of handling multiple low latency short operations as well as complex queries that iterate over large datasets simultaneously.

## State Sharing in SnappyData
A SnappyData cluster is designed to be a long-running clustered database. The state is managed in tables that can be shared across any number of connecting applications. Data is stored in memory and replicated to at least one other node in the system. Data can be persisted to disk in shared nothing disk files for quick recovery. Nodes in the cluster stay up for a long time and their lifecycle is independent of application lifetimes. SnappyData achieves this goal by decoupling its process startup and shutdown mechanisms from those used by Spark.
