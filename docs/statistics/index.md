# Evaluating Statistics for the System


SnappyData provides statistics for analyzing system performance. Any member of a distributed system, including SnappyData servers, locators, and peer clients, can collect and archive this statistical data.

SnappyData samples statistics at a configurable interval and writes them to an archive. The archives can be read at any time, including at runtime.

You can view and analyze runtime or archived historical data using  `snappy-shell stats` which is a command-line tool provided with the SnappyData product.

!!! Note

	- SnappyData statistics use the Java System.nanoTimer for nanosecond timing. This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy. For more information, see the online Java documentation for System.nanoTimer for the JRE you are using with SnappyData. 
	- Runtime viewing of statistics archives files is not necessarily real-time, because of file system buffering. </p>
