            drop table if exists colTable;
            show tables;

For secure connections, refer [Creating a Secure Connection from JDBC Client Tools](#secureconnectJDBC)

!!!Note
	When connecting to SnappyData, if a SQL client tool sets JDBC autocommit to false and transaction isolation level such as read committed or repeatable read is used,  the unsupported operations such as those on column table will produce an error - **Operations on column tables are not supported when query routing is disabled or autocommit is false.**   In such cases, connection property **allow-explicit-commit=true** can be used in the connection URL to avoid this error. Refer to configuration parameters section <add a link to the section> for details on this property. For example,  JDBC URL: **jdbc:snappydata://locatoHostName:1527/allow-explicit-commit=true**

## Creating a Secure Connection from JDBC Client Tools

If you already have an LDAP server,  you can use the same to connect to SnappyData cluster or you can use the LDAP server that comes pre-configured with SnappyData. 

To start the pre-configured LDAP server of SnappyData, do the following:

1.	From the terminal, go to the location of ldap-test-server: <br> `cd $SNAPPY_HOME/store/ldap-test-server`
2.	Run the following command to build: <br>`./gradlew build`
3.	Run the script: <br>`./start-ldap-server.sh auth.ldif`<br>
	This starts the LDAP server and prints the LDAP conf. The printed LDAP conf contains the username and password of LDAP that should be used to connect from JDBC clients. Copy this into the leads/servers/locators conf files of SnappyData.
4.	Start the SnappyData cluster.
5.	When you are connecting from a JDBC client, ensure to provide the user name and password printed in step 3.
