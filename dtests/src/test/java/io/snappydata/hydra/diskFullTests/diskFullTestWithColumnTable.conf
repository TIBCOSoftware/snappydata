hydra.Prms-testDescription = "This test starts the snappy cluster.
    Creates column tables with key columns . After initialization,data is ingested in the cluster using inserts.
    In parallel to the ingestion task , we also execute fallocate command to create files of specific size in order to create the disk full situation.
    In closeTask, the cluster is shutdown ,the pre created files are cleared ,so as to free up disk space.
    Then the cluster is started and validation is done to check if cluster is up and running and that there is no data loss";
