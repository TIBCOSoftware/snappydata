# Gradle daemon has been disabled due to two reasons:
#  1) It frequently fails after a few runs due to OOME.
#  2) Messes up buildOutput.log by writing to it multiple
#     times, increasing by one in every run i.e. first run
#     will be good, then second run will write each line twice,
#     third run thrice and so on. Clearing the loggerService
#     explicitly makes no difference.
